# PaysafeCash Back End Integration / Auto-capture - REST API
[PaysafeCash](https://www.paysafecash.com/en-gb/) is an alternative cash-based payment method that makes it possible to pay securely and easily with cash on the Internet.
Using PaysafeCash, products or services can be ordered online and then paid for with cash offline at the nearest payment point by scanning a QR/barcode. 

More information can be found at https://www.paysafecash.com/business.


# Integration Process Overview

The following steps need to be completed in order to integrate PaysafeCash in a webshop:

+ **Test Data**: PaysafeCash provides the test data package. This contains an API key (for authentication), merchant account ID and a link to the downloads page.
+ **Integration in the Test Environment**: The business partner integrates PaysafeCash into their test environment. Detailed information about the payment flow and API calls are contained below in this documentation.
+ **Integration Test**: As soon as the integration is completed in the test environment, the business partner must provide an URL and 2 test users to PaysafeCash. The PaysafeCash integration team will test the integration (technical payment flow and brand assurance).
+ **Productive Data**: Once the integration test is successful, PaysafeCash provides the productive data (API key).
+ **Switch to Production**: The business partner switches the PaysafeCash integration to the production environment (change API endpoints and API key).
+ **IP whitelisting**: The business partner must whitelist in the Merchant Service Center, the IPs used to connect to the production environment.
+ **Productive and BA check**: The business partner provides an URL and 2 test users to PaysafeCash. The technical support team will then process a real money end-to-end test and check if the integration is done accordingly to the interface guidelines.
+ **Go-Live**: As soon as the final check is completed successfully, the integration is finished and can be used for end customers.

# Technical Integration

## Merchant Service Center
The business partner must be registered in the [Merchant Service Center](https://servicecenter.paysafecard.com/merchant-center/) to get the necessary data to connect to the PaysafeCash system.

When using the MSC, the business partner complies with the provisions of the user manual for the MSC (downloadable from https://www.paysafecash.com/business/downloads).

## About the API
The PaysafeCash REST API follows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">*RESTful*</a> design principles making it easy to understand and integrate the API.
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture style, consisting of guidelines for creating scalable web services.

RESTful systems typically communicate over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) used by web browsers to retrieve web pages and send data to remote servers.

It also facilitates solid and universally accepted foundations like [*http basic authentication*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), [*http verbs*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods), [*JSON*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and [*CORS*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

## Versioning
Every time there is backwards-incompatible change to the API, a new major version will be released. This major version is part of the URL path.
The current major version is *v1*. Unless informed by our technical support department that we are dropping support for a particular API version, you do not need to switch API versions.

## Establishing a connection
A connection to the PaysafeCash system is successful if the following prerequisites are fulfilled:
- API key for request authentication provided by PaysafeCash.
- Authorization of the payment server IP address in the production environment (if a 403 error is received when trying to access the service, it is likely that the IP address is not yet allowed to access).
- Content-type: Please make sure that the content type in the HTTP header, when submitting requests, is set to **Content-Type: application/json**
- Character encoding needs to be in UTF-8

Connect to our services only via respective FQDNs
Do not cache DNS resolutions of PaysafeCash FQDNs in your infrastructure (Client servers, Resolvers etc.). The DNS resolutions should expire as soon as the TTL is reached.
In case your application is based on Java, please check your TTL setup on JVM, the DNS caching behavior needs to be adjusted to:
networkaddress.cache.ttl=60 (TTL 60 seconds). Please note that, this parameter needs to be persisted in the JVM security config
If your application is based on any other framework that caches DNS resolution, please make sure to set the DNS TTL to no more than 60 seconds or rely on the TTL set by our DNS records

Honoring DNS changes will make sure that you connect always to our active system.

## API key authentication
Every request to the API is authenticated using an API key.
- The value of the **API key needs to be base64 encoded** when transmitted in the HTTP header!
- Set the key as the username. [*HTTP basic authentication*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
- Your API key may only be used from your backend systems.
- **Please note:** Your API key must be kept secured - never expose the API key to anybody!

Below is an example of how the API key is supposed to be set (please note that the example cannot be used for requests).

```
Authorization: Basic cHNjXzYydXdPYkJnRkxn000XeXZwSlMtNE9weXRtUS1XN3Y=
```

## Test Environment and Endpoints
Every new business partner needs to first integrate the PaysafeCash API on the test environment.
Once the integration is finished, a UAT(User Acceptance Test) needs to be done in order to ensure a seemless integration flow.

- The endpoint for the *test environment* is: https://apitest.paysafecard.com/v1/


| Hostname  | IP address  |
|---|---|
| https://apitest.paysafecard.com/v1/   | 13.248.157.194 <br> 76.223.29.211  |

- The endpoint for the *production environment* is: https://api.paysafecard.com/v1/

| Hostname  | IP address  |
|---|---|
| https://api.paysafecard.com/v1/  | 75.2.1.208<br>99.83.185.216 |

## Interface Guidelines
PaysafeCash must be implemented accordingly to the interface guidelines (delivered with the data package) and the instructions in this technical integration document.

<br></br>
<br></br>

# Payment flow
In this section, the payment flow is shown.

![transaction_flow_backend](https://www.paysafecash.com/fileadmin/5_API/transaction_flow_lvl3_backend.PNG "PaysafeCash Backend Integration Payment Flow")

- The customer selects PaysafeCash as the preferred payment option in your webshop.

- The business partner initiates the payment with the correct amount, currency and other parameters.

- The business partner generates the barcode for this specific payment.

- The business partner displays the barcode to the customer according to the PaysafeCash interface guidelines.

- The customer brings the barcode to a payment point, has it scanned and pays for the transaction amount. A predefined time frame ("Transaction Timeout‚Äù) will be available for the payment completion. 

    The duration of this time frame is by default 72 hours, unless specified otherwise by the business partner.

- Once the payment is done at the POS, the money will be assigned to the transaction and PaysafeCash captures the payment on behalf of the business partner.

- A webhook notification request is sent to the business partner. 

- The business partner must verify the webhook notification as described [here](#webhook_notification).

- Upon successfully verifying the webhook notification, the business partner completes the transaction in its database and delivers the product/service to the customer.

**Important:** Captured payments are irreversible.

# Group Payment Process
<a name="payment_process"></a>
This section describes in detail the technical process of a PaysafeCash payment.

1. The customer selects the PaysafeCash payment method.

1. Initiate Payment: Send POST request `initiate Payment`
    * 2.1. If the response gives back http20x, redirect the customer to the barcode application (status of the transaction is "INITIATED").
    * 2.2. If the response gives back http40x or htp50x, show an error message to the customer.
        
        Initiate Payment error message: *"Transaction could not be initiated due to connection problems. If the problem persists, please contact our (business partner) support."*
        
1. Generate barcode: Send POST request `generate barcode` (status of the transaction is "INITIATED")
    * 3.1. The barcode is returned as part of the response.
    * 3.2. The business partner displays the barcode to the customer.
        
1. The customer brings the barcode to a payment point, has it scanned and pays for the transaction amount.

1. Webhook notification delivery: Since the transaction is paid and the amount assigned to the transaction, PaysafeCash captures the payment on behalf of the business partner (transaction status "SUCCESS") and the webhook notification is sent.

1. The business partner verifies the webhook notification as described [here](#webhook_notification).

1. Upon successfuly verifying the webhook notification, the business partner completes the transaction in its database and delivers the product/service to the customer.

**Important:** Captured payments are irreversible.

## customer id
<a name="customer_id"></a>
Also known as "Merchant Client ID", the customer id is an important parameter for the integration of PaysafeCash.

The customer id identifies the Customer on our business partners side. 

The most optimal customer id is a completely random value. A value that uniquely identifies the customer and is disconnected from any personal information. 

This value should be the same for all transactions of the customer.

Here are Guidelines for possible customer ids: 
<br><br/>
<br><br/>
**Valid Values:**
|Value |Type 
|--- |---
`2c3be0b50c7a5f1964a63d78f38a6ffc41c027e9` |SHA1 - test@123.com

`3192481752123`| Random Customer Identifier
`CustomerID1`| Customer Identifier free of personal information

<br><br/>
**Invalid Values:**
+ `test@123.com`
+ `Username_1`
+ `FirstName123`
+ `LastName123`
+ `Timestamp`
+ `IP Address`


Please note that sending any form of the invalid values will not be accepted. 

If you intend to process payments on multiple brands, please inquire about the possibilities of separating multiple entities for your account.

# Group Payment API Requests

## Initiating a payment [/payments]
Every PaysafeCash payment begins with an `initiate payment` request.

<br></br>

Upon successful execution of this request, the status of the payment is `INITIATED`.

<br></br>
<br></br>
**Note:** Using the optional HEADER-Parameter `Correlation-ID`, the busines partner can set a part of the parameter `id` on its own.

- Max. length: 41 characters
- Allowed characters: "a-z, A-Z, 0-9,-,_"
- The value passed in this parameter must always be unique

### initiate payment [POST]
```
POST /payments/
```

If the integration type in use is **"Barcode Application Integration"**, the next step is to redirect the customer to the `auth_url`, which is returned as part of the response.

As soon as the customer has clicked on "Continue Shopping" in the barcode application (status of the transaction is `REDIRECTED`) or authorized the payment at a payment point (status of the transaction is `AUTHORIZED`),
the customer will be redirected to the `success_url` specified when creating the payment.

+ Parameters
    + `Correlation-ID`: `test_corr_001` (optional) - Using the optional HEADER-Parameter `Correlation-ID`, the business partner can set part of the parameter `id` on its own. <br></br><br></br> - Max. length: 41 characters <br></br><br></br> -  Allowed characters for the `Correlation-ID` are "a-z, A-Z, 0-9,-,_" <br></br><br></br>  - The value passed in this parameter must always be unique <br></br><br></br>

## Retrieving payment details [/payments/{id}]

Upon successful `success_url` redirection, the business partner must call `retrieve payment details` to verfiy the status of the payment
and display the correct message to the customer, as shown in the [Payment Process](#payment_process) section.

<br></br>

Here, the transaction `id` is used to retrieve the details of that specific PaysafeCash payment.

### retrieve payment details [GET]
```
GET /payments/{id}
```

**Note**: Retrieving the details of a payment can be done at any time and it can be used to update the status of a specific payment displayed to the customer.

Other errors can be communicated to the customer as ‚Äúgeneral technical error‚Äù. 

In general when one of these errors occur, the business partner should contact PaysafeCash immediately via integration@paysafecard.com if the account is not live.

For live accounts, techsupport@paysafecard.com should be contacted.

# Group Webhook notification
<a name="webhook_notification"></a> The *webhook notification* is an HTTP `POST` request sent to the business partner endpoint provided in the `initiate payment` request, as soon as a payment is captured by PaysafeCash (status "SUCCESS"), the payment is actively cancelled (status "CANCELLED_CUSTOMER" or "CANCELLED_MERCHANT") or the payment expires (status "EXPIRED"). 

The business partner payment server must respond with *HTTP 200* and the authenticity of the webhook notification must be verified, as well as process the payment matching the details in the body of the message.
<br><br>
During the onboarding, the PaysafeCash team will provide a public key to the business partner which can be used to verifiy the authenticity of the webhook notification.
<br><br>
In case of technical errors (e.g. socket timeout) or application errors, the webhook notification is resubmitted at a regular interval of 1 minute until one of the following criteria is fulfilled:

- The notification is successfully delivered (i.e. HTTP 200 response from payment server).
- The maximum number of retry attempts has been reached (currently configured at 5 retries).
- The webhook notification will be sent from either of the below IP addresses:

| IP addresses  |
|---|
|  18.197.120.90 <br>18.158.237.76 <br>3.64.155.76 <br>3.76.4.148 <br>3.127.123.143 <br>176.34.172.250 <br>54.228.173.185 <br>52.48.213.182 <br>18.200.202.144 |


# Group Additional webhook notification for money handover
If requested, Paysafe can activate an additional webhook notification which is sent as soon as the customer paid at the store.

This webhook notification uses the `eventType` "MONEY_HANDOVER".

<b>Important</b>: this is not yet a confirmation that the transaction was successful, but you can update the transaction status to "processing" or "pending" on your end.

We expect you to credit the customer only when you receive the webhook notification with the event type "PAYMENT_CAPTURED".

- This notification uses the same IP addresses as the normal webhook notification.
- It uses the same type of verification - see the chapter below.
- This notification needs to be enabled on our side, so you need to request it from PaysafeCash.
- The notification will be sent between 0-30 seconds after the customer paid.
- It will be sent to the same URL as the normal webhook notification - the one specified in the payment request.
- The transaction status will <b>NOT</b> be updated, so you cannot confirm this with a `retrievePayment` request.
- In case the notification fails to get delivered, we attempt up to 5 retries.
    - This means you could receive a "MONEY_HANDOVER" notification after the transaction was already successful. In these cases, please confirm the transaction status with a `retrievePayment`.
<!-- - It does not make any retry attempts in case the initial notification fails. -->


HTTP body
```http

# Group Additional webhook notification for money returned at POS

If requested, Paysafe can also activate one more additional webhook notification which is sent as soon as a successful payment is cancelled at the point of sale and the funds are returned.

This webhook notification uses the `eventType` "MONEY_RETURNED".

<b>Important</b>: this is a confirmation that the funds have been returned to the customer at the point of sale and any credit you have done on your side needs to be reversed. The transaction status should be updated after you have received a different webhook event or preferably after checked with a GET call.

- This notification uses the same IP addresses as the normal webhook notification.
- It uses the same type of verification - see the chapter below.
- This notification needs to be enabled on our side, so you need to request it from PaysafeCash.
- The notification will be sent between 0-360 seconds after the customer received the funds back.
- It will be sent to the same URL as the normal webhook notification - the one specified in the payment request.
- The transaction status will <b>NOT</b> be updated, so you cannot confirm this with a `retrievePayment` request.
- In case the notification fails to get delivered, we attempt up to 5 retries.
This means you could receive a "MONEY_RETURNED" notification after receiving a "MONEY_HANDOVER" one or a "PAYMENT_CAPTURED" one. This will indicate an incomplete payment and the partner will need to recheck the payment status via GET call or wait for other webhook events.
<!-- - It does not make any retry attempts in case the initial notification fails. -->

<br><br>
The signature is created as follows:
```
signature = base64encode(rsa_encrypt(sha256(body), merchantPrivateKey))
```
And it is verified as follows:
```
rsa_decrypt(base64decode(signature), merchantPublicKey) == sha256(body)
```

<br><br>
###Using the *[openssl dgst](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/dgst.html)* function to verify the signature

The digest functions can be used to verify digital signatures using message digests. The three steps below ilustrate how this can be done:

1. Extract the public key from the rsa key file sent with the data package
    ```
    openssl rsa -RSAPublicKey_in -in webhook_signer_MANXXXXXXXXXX_1.rsa -out webhook_signer_MANXXXXXXXXXX_1_extracted.pem
    ```

2. Decode the signature of the webhook notification with base64
    
    Linux: ```base64 --decode signature.txt > signature_debase64.txt```
    
    Windows: ```certutil.exe -decode signature.txt signature_debase64.txt```
    
3. Verify the signature using the *[openssl dgst](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/dgst.html)* function

    The generic name, dgst, may be used with an option specifying the algorithm to be used. The default digest is sha256.
    
    ```
    openssl dgst -sha256 -verify webhook_signer_MANXXXXXXXXXX_1_extracted.pem -signature signature_debase64.txt plaintext_payload.txt
    ```

    |Parameter                                                      |Description    |
    |---                                                            |---                                                                 |
    |`-verify webhook_signer_MANXXXXXXXXXX_1_extracted.pem.pem`     |Verifies the signature using the public key extracted in step 1. The output is either `Verification OK` or `Verification Failure`. |
    |`-signature signature_debase64.txt`                            |The actual signature to verify in plain text, obtained in step 2.  |
    |`plaintext_payload.txt`                                        |The body of the request in plain text.  |

# Group Variable Transaction Timeout

<a name="variable_trx_timeout"></a> Upon the creation of the barcode, the customer is given a time frame to go to a payment point and pay for the transaction. 
This time frame is limited between the transaction creation and (if no payment happens) the expiration of the transaction. 

The default time frame is 72 hours and the customer will see in the barcode application how much time is left to pay with the barcode. 
<br><br>
There is the possibility to set this timeout per transaction. The timeout can be specified in the `initiate payment` request using the parameter `expiration_time_minutes`.

The allowed span for this parameter is between 5 and 20160 minutes. If no specific setting is used, the default setting is taken.

# Group Customer Data Takeover
To make the user experience as flawless as possible, a new feature is introduced.

Using the "Customer Data Takeover" feature, the business partner sends customer data (full name, DoB, etc.) to PaysafeCash in the `initiate payment` call, so the registration form in the barcode application is prefilled. 

**Important**: PaysafeCash does not store this data. It is solely used to make the customer registration easier. The data is only accessible if the transaction is in an open status and it is dropped afterwards.

+ If a middle name is to be sent during the data exchange, the business partner must combine the customer middle name with the `first_name` parameter.

+ It is crucial that the international calling code of the phone number and the country is matching. Otherwise, the number is dropped and not prefilled in the registration form.

# Group KYC reliance
If you have already verified the customer, we can process this KYC data via API request to make necessary checks on our end during the transaction creation.

To use this feature, the Customer Data Takeover parameters (see above) and additional KYC reliance parameters are mandatory - please see the `initiate payment` API call for details. These parameters need to be send in the "customer_takeover_data" -> "document" object.

The additional parameters include the document ID, document type, document date of issuance and expiry, document issuing authority and tax ID.

- If the checks on our end fail, we will return the error code 3161 ("action_not_allowed").
- Since the Customer Data Takeover is mandatory for this feature, we will return the error code 3150 ("missing_mandatory_parameter") in case one of the parameters is missing.
- If the KYC data is invalid, we will return the error code 10028 ("invalid_request_parameter")
- If the customer reached their limit, we will return the error code 33005 ("merchant_client_limit_reached")

# Group KYB reliance
KYB reliance is a special version of KYC reliance where instead of verifying a customer, you are verifying the business.

To use this feature, all parameters from the KYC reliance solution are mandatory, and you will have to supply an additional parameter - the merchant category code `mcc`.

The `mcc` parameter needs to be in the list below, otherwise the transaction will be declined. Please contact us if you have any questions regarding the mcc codes.

# Group Refund Information
The refund feature provides the business partners the possibility to fully or partially refund a previously paid transaction back into the
customer‚Äòs PaysafeCard account.

A refund will always be issued in the currency of the original payment transaction.

Refunding a payment is possible up to 45 days after the initial payment.

- Prerequisites
    - The business partner needs to have the merchant refund REST functions implemented on the website or back-end system.
    - The business partner needs to be fully integrated and refund needs to be enabled at PaysafeCash‚Äôs side.
    - The customer needs to be registered with PaysafeCard in order to receive a refund.
    - A refund transaction always refers to a previous underlying payment, because of this reason it is required that a
        payment has been processed before the refund can be processed.

- Settlement

    All successfull refunds will be deducted from the payments (netting) on the montly invoice that PaysafeCash
sends to the business partners.

- Credit Limit

    You cannot refund a higher amount than the amount you had in payments in one billing cycle. 
    
    To prevent failed refunds at the beginning of a billing cycle, it is possible to assign an additional Credit Limit to your account. The duration of the billing cycle is defined in the contract.

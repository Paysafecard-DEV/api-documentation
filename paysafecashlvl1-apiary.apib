# Paysafecash Link or QR code / Manual payment processing (MSC)

Paysafecash offers the possibility for business partners to start processing payments with minimal or no technical integration.

Business partners can use a light version of the integration, as described in this documentation, and step-by-step extend it to support heavier usage and automated processing of goods and services.

## Integration prerequisites

The business partner is provided access to the Merchant Service Center. When using the MSC, the business partner complies with the provisions of the user manual for the MSC (downloadable from https://www.paysafecash.com/en/business/downloads).
<br><br>
Paysafecash must be implemented accordingly to the interface guidelines (downloadable from https://www.paysafecash.com/business/downloads) and the instructions in this technical integration document.

## Transaction Flow

![transaction_flow](https://www.paysafecash.com/fileadmin/5_API/transaction_flow.PNG "Paysafecash Payment Flow")

A Paysafecash Transaction is processed as follows:

+ The business partner displays the payment hyperlink or QR-Code to the customer, using the correct Merchant ID and amount, as specified in the next section.

+ The customer initiates the payment by clicking the hyperlink or by scanning the QR-code.

+ The customer verifies that the payment details (including, but not limited to: payee, amount and payment reference) are correct and confirms the transaction. 

+ The Paysafecash payment is created on the behalf of the business partner according to the payment details in the confirmation page and the customer is redirected to the barcode panel.

+ The barcode is displayed to the customer and it will only be valid for this specific transaction. The barcode can be viewed in various ways (e.g. online, Paysafecash app, download, e-mail, SMS or iOS / Android passbook file). A predefined time frame ("Transaction Timeout‚Äù) will be available to the customer to pay the transaction amount at a payment point. The duration of this time is by default 72 hours, unless specified otherwise by the business partner.

+ To complete the Paysafecash payment, the customer must head to a payment point, have it scanned and pay the transaction amount. If the customer does not pay within the Transaction Timeout, the Paysafecash Transaction expires. If the payment is successful, the customer receives a receipt confirming the payment.

+ The Paysafecash payment is captured on behalf of the business partner.
In the rare occasion that the Paysafecash payment system is down due to an outage or any other technical circumstance, the capture of the payment will be delayed but it will be executed.

+ A successful payment notification email is sent to the business partner. To prevent fraudulent activities, the notification does not include the payment details.

+ Upon receiving the notification, the business partner must log into the Merchant Service Center within 24 hours, verify the payment and deliver the product.

**Important:** Captured payments are irreversible. The business partner cannot cancel the Paysafecash payment at any time during the transaction process.
